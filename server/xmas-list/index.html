I usually use 5% by Rich Piana, I generally use Full As F*ck, since it doesnt have any caffeine. I’d be open to trying the Kill It that has caffeine in it, sounds comparable to the PreLift brand which is always good too. I dont like to go more than ~300mg or so of caffeine though because thats agressive. I usually get the orange one since thats what they have at the store but trying new flavors? Thats always fun! I like the red ones\nComputer Stuff Idk how desperately i need to update my computer but I’ve been thinking about it. I think theres some kind of issue with my motherboard but that can probably wait because im nervous about also having to get a new CPU if thats the case. Though it is on the radar. I definitely want to get a new CPU Cooler. Thats the fan that cools the CPU. The CoolerMaster basic CPU fan is pretty nice, its only like 30 or 40$ and it would do the trick. It has quiet fans which is nice becuase mine makes an annoying hum, and I like the way the fan is pointing in the CoolerMaster one. Black would probably be good. I also wouldnt mind a mouse pad or a keybaord. I think I am in the market for a new mechanical keyboard. Mine takes up a lot of room and its sort of annoying. ReDragon has some cool inexpensive ones, they also have hotswappable switches which is nice. I had been considering getting low profile clicky switches/keys but after trying the ReDragon keys i think mine are just bad and its not the switches. I actualy tried clickies recently and dont think i like them that much. I would consider tactiles (in fact thats probably best cuz i can reuse my linear keys from my corsair board if i want to). For a mousepad, probably anything is fine honestly, maybe one on the slightly bigger side just so it covers my mouse area, usually gaming mouse pads are bigger than like office ones, but I probably wouldnt get one the size of the entire desk very likely.\nClothes Now that I’m old, clothes are also always nice. Not having to buy them is wonderful. Emma got me on Darn Tough socks (im size 13 which I think is XL). Shirts are also always fun. I like fun silly designs that either pertain to something that I like (I would kill for a Vim shirt) or just things that dont belong on tshirts.\nMisc A rugby ball would be cool too… and a rugby jersey from the world cup if anyone wanted to really go all out. The springboks (south africa) are cool. I like Kitshoff, Faf de Klerk. Or Bundee Aki from Ireland. Also as always anything LOTR related lol, apparel or what-have-you.\n",
