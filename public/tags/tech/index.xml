This would be day one of using my flip phone. A few things. First thing I noticed is how awful the group texts are. For example, someone sent me a regular old group text message and it delivered as if they had texted me individually, I have to then click on the MMS they send, download it, then it opens up in a group text with the other people. I can reply that way, but when they send a message it goes right back to their solo contact. So a group chat where people are texting a lot would be a nightmare. As soon as my friends text to ask if I wanna hang out, that text could be rough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
