      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a little segment that includes my thoughts on stoicism, how it is used as a means to financial or material gain, and how that might be contradictory to the foundations of the philosophy. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of rambling, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to type it all out so this is what we get mwahhhahahah.</description>

      <description>When I was a sophomore I took a class called biopsychology where I sat next to a girl writing her honors thesis on philosophy in American media. I have since lost touch with her but I still thing about her ideas regularly. One aspect of philosophy that her and I particularly discussed was stoicism. Itâ€™s an aspect of philosophy that has taken over, at least in my circles.
I frequently see it present in gym culture, a subculture I spend a fair bit of time in.</description>
