      <description>I am congested, sorry. Also I sound very mean, I swear I&amp;rsquo;m not.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a little thing about the use of video overlays like Subway Surfer or Family Guy over online content. I think I&amp;rsquo;m generally against the idea as it feels like a disctraction but by the end of this I started to wonder if having a small distraction like this might be worse than fully focusing on the video, but still better than all together losing interest in the video?</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a little segment that includes my thoughts on stoicism, how it is used as a means to financial or material gain, and how that might be contradictory to the foundations of the philosophy. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of rambling, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to type it all out so this is what we get mwahhhahahah.</description>

      <title>Healthy or concious?</title>

      <description>Recently I was thinking about when people make health decisions, like to cut out carbs, or to go vegan. Often they say they feel pretty good. On the other hand there&amp;rsquo;s often the argument that &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be skinny, you want the feeling that you think you&amp;rsquo;ll have when you&amp;rsquo;re skinny&amp;rdquo; which I think is pretty interesting. Obviously not everyone is making health decisions to be skinny, but it seems across the board that it generally seems to be a positive thing for the peope making the change.</description>

      <title>Contemplating normalcy</title>

      <description>The other day I was driving home and I was thinking about how normal I feel. I feel like on average I assume that I&amp;rsquo;m smack in the middle of the bell curve (I haven&amp;rsquo;t added a comment box yet so you all can&amp;rsquo;t tell me where you think I fall, I don&amp;rsquo;t need that kind of negativity in my life). Anyway, my point with this is how predicatble I feel becuase of this.</description>

      <title>Stoicism in Social Media</title>

      <description>When I was a sophomore I took a class called biopsychology where I sat next to a girl writing her honors thesis on philosophy in American media. I have since lost touch with her but I still thing about her ideas regularly. One aspect of philosophy that her and I particularly discussed was stoicism. Itâ€™s an aspect of philosophy that has taken over, at least in my circles.
I frequently see it present in gym culture, a subculture I spend a fair bit of time in.</description>
