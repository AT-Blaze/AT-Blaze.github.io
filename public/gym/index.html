  <div class="post-content"><p>i guess i have to imagine that a lot of my contempt for the gym comes from being self concious but its just easier to complain about the culture than it is to deal with the reality that im not content with my lifestyle or habits.</p>
<p>but i also think that its somewhat unfair to recognize that as an absolution of the culture itself. I guess ill write this down to see if im actually just a little bitch or if there is something beyond just my self conciousness. But id say that the very self concious feeling i have at the gym is hard to ignore becuase its built into the predatory nature of the marketing as it is. But i guess ill come back to that.</p>
<p>The first thing that seems to bother me at the gym is the homogeneity of the gymgoers. Which, to be fair, i am sure are less homogenous than I think, but still more homogenous than i think it should be. I would be willing to bet that many of the people that frequent the gym would agree its probably one of those things that everyone should do, as its almost fundamental to who we are, as important ase eating and sleeping (which i suppose contributes to the homogeneity as all of the people there share that in common, but that never really feels like whats bringing these people together). The thing about my gym in particular is that, if its just about people working out because working out is natural and fundamental to our being then why does it feel so homogenous? Shouldnt there be all sorts of different people there? Like all kinds, literally every single kind of person? Obviously not, and thats obviously not what happens there.</p>
<p>Sure there is a lot of different types of people there, theres my parents for example, so we know theres CPAs there, theres IT people there, I know there&rsquo;s doctors there, two doctors I work with work out there, theres contractors, people who do manual labor, and theres people who just work there. I suppose the obvious elephant in the room is that all of the people who go there have one thing in common, and thats that they can afford to go there. And thats a major elephant&hellip;</p>
<p>My gym costs, at the time of writing this, a ridiculous $280 dollars a month. Thats fucking outrageous. Like&hellip; beyong comprehension. holy shit. If thats not enough to make you walk away right there then idk what is, and i guess thats the obvious thing that seperates the people that go there and the people that dont. That price is un-fucking-real to me. I mean if the average person manages to go 5 times a week (and i think anyone who beleives they will go five times a week EVERY week is lying to themselves) youre paying something around 15$ a visit. And according to the website, with the price increase thats coming in January of 2024, you very likely will be spending over 15$ a visit. That doesnt even take into account the fact that its a &ldquo;health club&rdquo; so you end up paying for things like the food they sell downstairs, or the drinks they have at the bar becuase now theres a bar at the gym? or the fact that they still charge extra for certain classes or times. And the crazy part is, they dont care. The people running the place just do not care about the cost. The gym is getting more and more busy every day. My parents used to play pickleball there and when they started there was something like a hundred or so players, I could just show up and play if I wanted. Now? theres over 500 people playing there. OVER 500! You need to reserve court time weeks in advance and in the entire time that my parents have been there the accomodations have not increased whatsoever. The same number of courts, and now 5 times the number of people there. And why doesnt the club care? because new people are signing up every day&hellip; and dont worry, the 2024 price increase is coming in a few days! So no need to fear becuase its only a matter of time before the people who are there now simply cant afford to pay their memberships anymore, and then, youre back to not being overcrowded. At least thats one way of looking at it, but the fact of the matter is the gym will still be overcrowded and though some people will leave, there will still be more than the club can handle paying an exorbanant price to go there.</p>
<p>The club costs more per year for one person that it costs to get an entire year long membership for an entire family at the country club down the road. I mean, plain and simple, this gym rivals the best country clubs in the area in terms of exclusivity and luxury. Perhaps I dislike it for that reason alone, beyond my own self conciousness being in the club, its a very thinly veiled manifestation of quite possibly the worst aspects of the american economy. But in the clubs defense this isnt something it doesnt acknowledge, it is 100% advertised as a luxury country club, and it doesnt pretend to be cheap. But i still think its a valid criticism of the model.</p>
<p>The people that go there are also very intense. Like, working out isnt just a thing they do to be healthy people, at least thats how it seems. Now this is a part where I would say that my perception of the homogeneity is skewed. Meaning, there are probably a fair number of people who do just go to work out becuase their healthy, and the gym is a suitable place for them to do it and they dont mind spending the money. Those are the people I probably dont see a lot becuase they probably just go and leave, and they probably dont look like theyre on gear.</p>
<p>But there definitely seems to be others, people who this is like their whole life. Like it revovles around all of their time at the gym. I mean, when theirs like a hundred and 50 people in the grm at a time its no wonder i recognize the same people over and over again, but i seem to see a LOT of the same people, and I go at rather arbitrary times which really reinforces the notion that there are people who are spending an awful lot of time there. Also really makes me wonder what these people do for work that they can afford to be there all the time, they dont seem like college students on break thats for sure. Anyway, im sure to some extent this is a product of them spending so much. You either spend so much becuase it IS your life, or it becomes your life BECAUSE youre spending so much.</p>
<p>Thats the part that probably makes me self concious, there is a very real pressure that makes me feel self concious. Im just not there enough, or not as dedicated as the other people that go there. And I know thats not entirely true, because to some extent thats on me, why do i believe that? Im the one allowing myself to think that when I can just be ok not going as often as them, or having my own goals or not being as focused on my physique or whatever. Part of that self conciousness is indeed on me.</p>
<p>But as I said earlier, thats sort of the nature of gyms, or &ldquo;health clubs,&rdquo; they are exclusive and thats how they work. I mean i guess its sort of baked into the philosophy, people who work out are gonna be healthy so when you show up to a gym ofc youre gonna be surrounded by healthy, somehwhat like-minded people. Which is sort of inherintly &ldquo;othering&rdquo; as theres people who go to they gym, and theres the people who dont. I guess its sort of natural, its not malicious i guess, it just seems that the nature of the gym or that culture is built around that. Theres the gymers and the non-gymers, or the healthy people and the non-healthy people. And I know I know, im making it up its in my head, its my fault for feeling that way cuz why should i be the non gymer or the non healthy one. I could just believe that im the gymmer or im the healthy one, but i dont feel that way. Which is my fault.</p>
<p>Im sort of talking in circles here but as much as its my fault for not feeling like a gymer i also feel like maybe theres some merit to that. I dont feel that way at planet fitness. Now maybe I dont feel that way at planet fitness becuase im the strongest guy there, so when if i compare myself to others I feel good whereas at my gym thats not the case. So again, my fault, just dont compare yourself to others. But again, some of that is inherent. I feel that they club is built around that idea of what the healthy gymmer is, so its not just me not <em>feeling</em> like a gymmer, I am, to an extent, not a gymmer accoridng to the clubs archetype.</p>
<p>And that gets the homogeneity that I was saying I feel, I dont feel like i fit in with those people. And again ya ya could be my fault for comparing myself to them, but also as I said, when the club is built around a homogenous identity of gymmers and healthy people I think its hard not to feel that way. So, planet fitness becomes much more enjoyable because the environment is more welcoming and inclusive as opposed to the exclusive nature of my gym. (though as an aside i did once feel excluded at pfit and that was when I was in the best shape ive been, i felt actually sort of othered at pfit cuz i was the ONLY one who looked like that or trained like that and i felt a little too intense for pfit).</p>
<p>All the people at my gym are so uppity and fancy and strong and good looking, thats what its all about. Its an exclusive healthy club, the people drive fancy new cars, they always have fresh haircuts and neat beards, or the most expensive new gym clothes or shaker, or theyre taking the nicest newest most expensive suppliments. And thats not true for all of them, some dont dress like that and others drive less nice cars, but it certainly seems to be a minority, they stick out like a sore thumb. Hence the inherint othering. Then i guess its up to the indiviula to not let that bother them. So maybe ya, it is inherint to their model that there becomes a specific identity and its just my choice to let it bother me, but I do also think that its just a more enjoyable experience to conform, it feels better. Its nicer to be hot and wear nice clothes and sauna with ur friends and put on your rolex after and leave in your BMW, it seems like it would feel &lsquo;comfortable.&rsquo; So ya maybe being at the bottom of the social latter is what it is? idk. I guess im just annoyed that im not in that same situation. But also idk if i want to be, as i said earlier, it sometimes feels a little slimey, like the people at the desk wearing super nice suits and having super nice shoes and watches feels disingenuous or supeficial. But maybe thats just envy talking&hellip; These last 4 sentences are the reason i dont like the gym i think, i hate having to confront that question every single time i walk in becuase its glaringly fucking obvious everytime i walk in.</p>
<p>Also sometimes i wonder if i dont like going there becuase i just wanna feel special and quirky and all the people are better than me so i dont feel that but i do get to be special and quirky at pfit. But also thats not entirely true because at the gym i am quirky for being the only fat person and also i didnt feel very good being the strongest fella at pfit cuz i also always felt like people were staring at me. So i guess, naybe then the thing between those two thats consistent is feeling like everyones looking at me. So its not about being quirky and special, i guess its just being self concious. But i guess heres the outline for what it is about the gym that makes me feel that way, as well as the other stuff thats not just self concious but also the sort of grossy stuff about the culture that go beyong myself.</p>
<p>It is interesting though because i think i dont feel community at the gym and the more you do the more tolerable it is. So like i said earlier if i had a BMW and nice suit i probbaly would feel more community. But the fact that its built around being rich and inshape sort of takes the community out of it. Hence pfit feels better for me (but also when i was super strong and hot it was less community) so its more like wanting to fit in. But also i guess it becomes more complicated with my current gym becuase fitting in doesnt just mean going to the gym, it also means being fit, being hot, being rich, and all that other stuff. So i guess thats why and thats why i feel self concious? idk, i really dont know. Hence the part about idek if i want to feel community at my gym cuz it seems to be more than just being fit its also all the other stuff.</p>
<p>And also idek if i like the gym too cuz i think some of it is annoying like idk if i agree with needing to spend so much time lifting and if i agree with what feels like materialism and superficial things like fashion and how you look and all that garbage. Cuz you can read my blog posts about how much of lifting and being helthy is also wrapped up in grind culture and that stuff which i hate. And it seems at lifetime becuase its about being rich and not just being fit that you get a lot more of other grind there as opposed to at pfit where its cheaper so you get people who literally cant afford my gym, and also people who simply dont care about the optics and JUST want to lift.</p>
<p>so ya, that.</p>
