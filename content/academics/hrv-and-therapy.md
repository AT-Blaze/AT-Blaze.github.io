Here is a paper I wrote for my cognition class about heart rate variability and the implications the current research has on the creation and usage of therapeutic interventions. Mostly I focused on the data that existed for various different age groups, spanning from adolesence to geriatric subjects. The field as a whole, as it appears, is moving away from heart rate variability measures and instead favoring more reliable metrics that might infer the same things. This, however, is still relevant as it informs many of the decisions made today about how to approach treatment in these populations while maintaining a high standard of accuracy.
