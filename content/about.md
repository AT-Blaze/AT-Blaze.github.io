This is my website where I put all my blog posts. They're just what I think about and also I don't spell check them.

Additionally, I built this site myself with Hugo so its pretty bad, and also that means that it's not very feature heavy (until I learn how to add them). On the bright side, since I figured out how to add audio files to my site, those exist now!

Besides that, I'm a college student so this is a side hobby, usually something I do when I'm busy procrastinating my thesis and actual work!

For anyone interested, heres a list of my personal records for various fitness activities that I think are probably worth noting. I haven't included anything silly like front squat, calf raise, hamstring curl, or overhead press, just the stuff people usually ask about:
