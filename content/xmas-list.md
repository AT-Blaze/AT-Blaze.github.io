For the people wondering what to get me that don't know what I like, or what I'm up to these days, here are some updates about me.

&nbsp;
### **Pre-Workout** 

This stuffs kinda expensive, if I don't have to buy it, thats always good. Especially now that the store I usually go to (Green Mountain Smoothie) is far when you dont have a car (they sell gift cards tho).
&nbsp;

I usually use 5% by Rich Piana, I generally use Full As F*ck, since it doesnt have any caffeine. 
I'd be open to trying the Kill It that has caffeine in it, sounds comparable to the PreLift brand which is always good too. I dont like to go more than ~300mg or so of caffeine though because thats agressive. 
&nbsp;

I usually get the orange one since thats what they have at the store but trying new flavors? Thats always fun! I like the red ones

### **Computer Stuff**
&nbsp;

Idk how desperately i need to update my computer but I've been thinking about it. I think theres some kind of  issue with my motherboard but that can probably wait because im nervous about also having to get a new CPU if thats the case. Though it is on the radar. 
&nbsp;

I definitely want to get a new CPU Cooler. Thats the fan that cools the CPU. The CoolerMaster basic CPU fan is pretty nice, its only like 30 or 40$ and it would do the trick. It has quiet fans which is nice becuase mine makes an annoying hum, and I like the way the fan is pointing in the CoolerMaster one
I also wouldnt mind a mouse pad or a keybaord. I think I am in the market for a new mechanical keyboard. Mine takes up a lot of room and its sort of annoying. ReDragon has some cool inexpensive ones, they also have hotswappable switches which is nice. I had been considering getting low profile clicky switches/keys but after trying the ReDragon keys i think mine are just bad and its not the switches.

**Clothes**
&nbsp;

Now that I'm old, clothes are also always nice. Not having to buy them is wonderful. Emma got me on Darn Tough socks (im size 13 which I think is XL). Shirts are also always fun. I like fun silly designs that either pertain to something that I like (I would kill for a Vim shirt) or just things that dont belong on tshirts.
