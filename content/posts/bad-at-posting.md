I wanted to make another post today, and I definitely had an idea for one, but I since forgot what it was. But in order to get back into the groove of doing these, I figured I'd post this anyway. Who knows, maybe I'll think of something. 

The last post I made, I actually texted myself the idea for it so I would remember what it was cuz these things really come and go you know? So next time I'll have to do that too, otherwise it just slips the mind. Alright well, thats probably all for this then.

Well, I also did start taking film photos which was cool, maybe I'll throw a couple here.
