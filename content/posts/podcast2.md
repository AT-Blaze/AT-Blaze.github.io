I am congested, sorry. Also I soudn very mean, I swear I'm not. 

Here's a little thing about the use of video overlays like Subway Surfer or Family Guy over online content. I think I'm generally against the idea as it feels like a disctraction but by the end of this I started to wonder if having a small distraction like this might be worse than fully focusing on the video, but still better than all together losing interest in the video? But as I am writing this my recording is playing in the background and god I cannot focus...

You can hear me crack my knuckles @ 3:43 :)

Jackson you might like 5:45, take a listen.
