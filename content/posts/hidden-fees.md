I just signed up for a gym and lemme tell you, I've signed up for more than one gym before and I don't know how, but somehow, I forgot about all the hidden fees. 

I had gotten an email after my trial that there was no signing fee, but when I went in, there was some crazy annual fee. I guess I was less surprised by the fee and more by the fact that it was so much. 

And then the fee itself had all these taxes, and the membership had some "convenience fee." Why do I have to pay a convenience fee lol, it would be more convenient for me ot pay in cash... but I can't. 

And I have to download an app and make an account to sign in. What in the world? I don't want to make an account what the heck? and I don't want to need my phone?

I think I'm just gonna make them sign me in my name ever time lol. 

I think we need a world with less accounts, less phone dependence, and just more freedom.

Over the summer I went to a gym where you show up, give the lady at the desk $2.50 in cash, and thats it. And they give you a key for a locker if you ask. Or you could pay something like 25 bucks for a punch card with 12 visits on it. And you didn't even have to bring it with you, if you asked, the lady would keep it in a binder behind the desk. Plain and simple. I don't know, I'm sure theres some sueing or legal reason they need all that paperwork and all my signatures on everything and all that, but bring me back to my old gym. That place was real. 

Cash at the desk, and iron plates.
