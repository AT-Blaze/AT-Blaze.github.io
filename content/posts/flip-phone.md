This would be day one of using my flip phone. A few things. First thing I noticed is how awful the group texts are. For example, someone sent me a regular old group text message and it delivered as if they had texted me individually, I have to then click on the MMS they send, download it, then it opens up in a group text with the other people. I can reply that way, but when they send a message it goes right back to their solo contact. So a group chat where people are texting a lot would be a nightmare. As soon as my friends text to ask if I wanna hang out, that text could be rough. 

Not sure if thats a result of any group chat? Or if it's because theres something weird with the AppleID thing.

Another thing, there's ads on the KaiOS native apps :|
and you can hardly use any non KaiOS apps. If this works out, I think it might be worth switching to either something like a cat phone, or to the Verizon flip phone that has a better OS. 

Images that come in are super small and low res, can read anything anyone sends if it has text. Texting isnt too bad. I also got a text earlier and replied with a call which was well recieved, so thats exciting. 

Other than that, while I was at work I just checked my email or any other messaging services on my laptop.

Today I didn't bring my iphone with me to work, just my flip phone. One other thing is some of my contacts didn't sync, so I had one or two friends I wanted to text who I couldn't reach. Another thing is I reached out to a friend I hadn't talked to in a while, those convos can be hard because its too difficult to type everything out. I'm sure I'll get faster on the predictive keyboard as time goes on. 

Suprisingly havent had any 2FA things yet, so we'll see how that goes. No music on here yet either. I cant even change the background, its pretty mid lol. I would consider getting a more serious flip phone if I were gonna stick with it. Especially because I dont think this one supports RCS, which I think, if I understand it right, makes texts a lot more functional. We'll see how it goes.
