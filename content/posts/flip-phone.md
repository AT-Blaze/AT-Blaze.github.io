This would be day one of using my flip phone. A few things. First thing I noticed is how awful the group texts are. For example, someone sent me a regular old group text message and it delivered as if they had texted me individually, I have to then click on the MMS they send, download it, then it opens up in a group text with the other people. I can reply that way, but when they send a message it goes right back to their solo contact. So a group chat where people are texting a lot would be a nightmare. As soon as my friends text to ask if I wanna hang out, that text could be rough. 

Not sure if thats a result of any group chat? Or if it's because theres something weird with the AppleID thing.

Another thing, there's ads on the KaiOS native apps :|
and you can hardly use any non KaiOS apps. If this works out, I think it might be worth switching to either something like a cat phone, or to the Verizon flip phone that has a better OS. 

Images that come in are super small and low res, can read anything anyone sends if it has text. Texting isnt too bad. I also got a text earlier and replied with a call which was well recieved, so thats exciting. 

Other than that, while I was at work I just checked my email or any other messaging services on my laptop.
